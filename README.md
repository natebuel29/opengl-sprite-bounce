# OpenGL-Texture-Bounce

Recently got inspired to dive into the world of C++ and OpenGL. After completing the `Getting Started` section of [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/), i needed to work on something to apply what i learned. A game felt a bit ambitious so i decided to start with a simple texture bounce program, inspired by the classic bouncing DVD logo. I decided to use a really silly picture that my friend sent me months ago where he got extremely sun burnt and would sent the program to him as a joke.
