# OpenGL-Texture-Bounce

I recently got inspired to dive into the world of C++ and OpenGL. After completing the `Getting Started` section of [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/), I needed to work on something to apply what I learned. Coding a game felt ambitious so I started with a simple texture bounce program, inspired by the classic bouncing DVD logo. I decided to use a hilarious picture that my friend sent me months ago where he got extremely sunburnt and would send the program to him as a joke.
